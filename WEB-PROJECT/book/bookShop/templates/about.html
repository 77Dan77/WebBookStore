      <h1 style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Welcome to Bookshop!</h1>
      <div>
        Bookshop is an online bookstore with a mission to financially support local, independent bookstores.
      </div>
      <div>
        We believe that bookstores are essential to a healthy culture. They’re where authors can connect with readers,
        where we discover new writers, where children get hooked on the thrill of reading that can last a lifetime.
        They’re also anchors for our downtowns and communities.
      </div>
      <div>
        As more and more people buy their books online, we wanted to create an easy, convenient way for you to get your
        books and support bookstores at the same time.
      </div>
      <div>
        If you want to find a specific local bookstore to support,
        <a href="/pages/store_locator" class="hotlink">find them on our map</a> and they’ll receive the full profit off
        your order. Otherwise, your order will contribute to an earnings pool that will be evenly distributed among
        independent bookstores (even those that don’t use Bookshop).
      </div>
      <div>
        We also support anyone who advocates for books through our
        <a href="/affiliates/profile/introduction" class="hotlink">affiliate program</a>, which pays a 10% commission on
        every sale, and gives a matching 10% to independent bookstores. If you are an author, a website or magazine, have
        a bookclub, an organization that wants to recommend books, or even just a book-lover with an Instagram feed, you
        can sign up to be an affiliate, start your own shop, and be rewarded for your advocacy of books. Bookshop wants to
        give back to everyone who promotes books, authors, and independent bookstores!
      </div>
      <div>
        By design, we give away over 75% of our profit margin to stores, publications, authors and others who make up the
        thriving, inspirational culture around books!
      </div>
      <div>
        We hope that Bookshop can help strengthen the fragile ecosystem and margins around bookselling and keep local
        bookstores an integral part of our culture and communities.
      </div>
      <div>Bookshop is a benefit corporation - a corporation dedicated to the public good.</div>

      <h3>How does Bookshop work with independent bookstores?</h3>
      <p>
        Bookshop supports indies in two ways: 10% of regular sales on Bookshop.org are added to an earnings pool that is
        evenly divided and distributed to independent bookstores every six months.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stores that are affiliates, who sell books online using Bookshop (by sharing links their Bookshop link on social
        media, email newsletters, or on their websites) earn 30% of the cover price on any sales they generate, without
        having to do the work of keeping inventory, picking, packing, shipping or handling complaints and returns. (30% of
        the cover price is the entire profit margin - Bookshop doesn’t earn money off bookstore sales, all profits go to
        the store.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All orders are fulfilled through Ingram.
      </p>
      <h3>How does Bookshop promote local bookstores?</h3>
      <p>
        Every receipt we email customers informs them about the bookstores near them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a Bookshop customer opts in, their local bookstore will be given their email address for direct marketing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Affiliate stores can create recommendation lists (staff picks, etc) on Bookshop, boosting their visibility and
        earning a commission on every sale generated from the list.
      </p>
      <h3>If I’m an affiliate, do I have to disclose that on my website, newsletter or social media posts?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Whenever a link is used on your website that results in a commission, you must disclose this information to
        site visitors, according to FTC rules. We suggest adding something like: “Disclosure: I am an affiliate of
        Bookshop.org and I will earn a commission if you click through and make a purchase.” to your website or post.
      </p>
      <h3>If I'm an affiliate, how are the sales of my books handled?</h3>
      <p>
        Affiliates do not have to handle inventory, fulfillment, shipping, or customer service. All book sales are
        fulfilled by Ingram. Ingram’s extensive inventory and regional warehouse system ensures Bookshop that books can
        reach customers in as soon as 2-3 days.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I get paid for the books that sell, how much will you pay me, and when will you pay it?</h3>
      <p>
        Affiliates can withdraw their revenue whenever they like via an easy web interface, provided they have a balance
        of $20 or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookstores participating in the revenue share will receive payments every six months. The revenue share will be
        divided equally among partners.
      </p>
      <h3>What kind of reporting will I receive, and how frequently?</h3>
      <p>
        Affiliates will be able to get reporting and see their sales activity at any time on their dashboard on our
        website, or download the transactions.
      </p>
      <h3>How do I set up an account?</h3>
      <p>
        Anyone can create an account at
        <a href="https://bookshop.org/affiliates/profile/introduction" class="hotlink">
          https://bookshop.org/affiliates/profile/introduction

      <h3>How do I advertise or promote a book on Bookshop?</h3>
      <p>Email us at <a href="mailto:ads@bookshop.org" class="hotlink">ads@bookshop.org</a></p>
      <h3>FAQ for Bookstores:</h3>
      <p>
        Bookstores with physical locations who are ABA members qualify for our Platform Seller program and can be added to
        our bookstore finder map, receive a 30% commission on sales, and receive customer order information. Please email
        Sarah at <a href="mailto:sarah.high@bookshop.org" class="hotlink">sarah.high@bookshop.org</a> if you qualify.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Can Bookshop take the place of my store’s website?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you’d like to have a website that features: event listings and ticketings, signed pre-order campaigns, custom
        merch, in-store pickup, etc. we recommend setting up a website through the ABA (IndieLite or IndieCommerce).
      </p>
      <p>
        Any bookstore that wants to use Bookshop as a simple page to sell books online can do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookshop pages are free!
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookshop pages allow you to sell books and earn 30% of the cover price without worrying about inventory,
        fulfillment, shipping, returns, or customer service.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookshop pages feature your short bio section, social media profiles, and a series of book lists curated by your
        store.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Is Bookshop replacing the ABA’s IndieCommerce and IndieLite sites?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Nope! IndieCommerce and IndieLite are not going away. Think of Bookshop as “IndieLiteLite,” a free, less
        customizable online storefront that requires no technical knowledge or investment. Stores happy with their online
        sites should choose whichever ecommerce site works best for them. Of course you may use Bookshop in addition to
        whichever online site you’re using.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Why does Bookshop discount books?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We are experimenting with discounting. If we find discounts are necessary to be a viable alternative for our
        customers, we may discount books. But to minimize the price difference between in-store purchases and online
        purchases, we will keep the discounts to 10% and under. And if we discover our customers are willing to shop
        without discounts, we may stop discounting! For now, we need the option as we A/B test and improve the platform.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Will Bookshop share customer info with affiliates?
      </h3>
      <p>
        For bookstores who use Bookshop to sell books, yes, unless the customer opts-out. We consider them your customers,
        and every sale generated through your store’s affiliate links will be made available to you. For normal
        affiliates, the answer is no, due to respect for our customer’s privacy.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How is Bookshop targeting online customers?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Bookshop is designed for generating affiliate revenue. Our team is working to build a network of publishers,
        authors, bookstagrammers, celebrity book clubs, and other media sites to target socially-conscious online
        consumers who are not yet buying their books online through an independent bookstore.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bookshop’s interface and purchase process is designed to be as convenient, streamlined, and user-friendly as
        possible, for an alternative that is just as easy as our competitors.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Do I need to provide my bank details?
      </h3>
      <p>
        If you’re an affiliate, whenever you want to withdraw funds, you can enter your bank details and Bookshop will
        allow you to transfer your funds at any time. Stores participating in the 10% revenue share pool will receive
        checks in the mail every six months, no need to share any info other than your name and address.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How do I list our store’s books with Bookshop’s platform?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Any books in Ingram’s inventory will automatically be listed when we launch. Specialty books and products that are
        not included in Ingram’s catalog may be added as we develop the platform in the future.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Will you sell audiobooks and or ebooks?
      </h3>
      <p>
        We sell ebooks via a partnership with Hummingbird - you can see the ebook links on any book product page. We will
        start selling audiobooks through a partnership with Libro.fm by the end of April, 2020.

      <h3>
        What will the shipping packaging from Bookshop look like?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Books shipped from Bookshop will arrive in simple packaging.
      </p>
      <h3>
        One of my customers wants a title not in the catalog. How can I get it on my storefront?
      </h3>
      <p>
        At launch, we will be limited to the books in Ingram’s catalog. By the end of 2020, we expect to have other
        partnerships and features in place that will allow us to carry materials, such as used books, and other specialty
        books and products that are not in Ingram’s inventory.
      </p>
      <h3>
        Does Bookshop allow for in-store pickup?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Bookshop will not feature in-store pickup. Stores wishing to have in-store pickup may look to IndieCommerce or
        IndieLite website options.
      </p>
      <h3>
        How do authors get paid? How much money does Bookshop keep? If Bookshop is giving 30% of a sale to a bookstore
        affiliate, what about the remaining 70%?
      </h3>
      <p>
        Bookshop doesn't make a profit off our Bookstore affiliate sales; we make a small percentage on all other sales.
        The publisher is generally paid about 50% of a book's sale price, and the publisher pays the author. About 20%
        goes to our customer discount, payment processing, and fulfillment costs.
      </p>
